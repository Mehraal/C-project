# C++ project3
# Author: Alex Mehr


# Description:
# This is the file for project 3 in the CS-210 course written in C++ 
# The project is the grocery item frequency finder to look up grocery items and the frequency of each item and 
# and record the data in a separate file.
# The purpose of this application is to provide a simple way for the store to get inventory details for ordering.

# What did you do particularly well?
#    I wrote a clean and readable code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
#    I could separate the files in the code so I have less code in the main file for debugging purposes and also more readability.
